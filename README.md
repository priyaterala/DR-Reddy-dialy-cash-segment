# DR Reddy Daily Share Price Prediction

Created an excel csv file which includes: 

date, 
daily adjested close price,
weekly adjested close price,
monthly adjested close price.

Since the value of daily cash segment not only depends on the previous day data, 
it also affects from news, company issues or progress which includes
weekly and monthly data also.
So, i created above 4 columns in my csv file(as my DataFrame).

This my first repo where i created my ML and Deep Learning Models 
on my own DataFrame .

Since iam beginning my TENSOR-FLOW coding journey, iam developing few ML models with the help 
of GOOGLE MACHINE LEARNING CRASH COURSE.

And iam working in google colab environment.

In this repo I created files:
1.How to work with Python Pandas using above dataframe,
