# DR Reddy Daily Share Price Prediction

Created an excel csv file which includes: 

date, 
daily adjested close price,
weekly adjested close price,
monthly adjested close price.

Since the value of daily cash segment not only depends on the previous day data, 
it also affects from news, company issues or progress which includes
weekly and monthly data also.
So, i created above 4 columns in my csv file(as my DataFrame).

This my first repo where i created my ML and Deep Learning Models 
on my own DataFrame .

Since iam beginning my TENSOR-FLOW coding journey, iam developing few ML models with the help 
of GOOGLE MACHINE LEARNING CRASH COURSE.

And iam working in google colab environment.

In this repo I created files:
1.Uploading csv file in to colab environment,
2.How to work with Python Pandas using above dataframe,
3.Implementing Linear Regressor Model using different Training and Test Data Frames.
4.Implementing Logistic Regression Model(Classification) for a defined threshold value and calculating Accuracy and AUC on the validation dataset
